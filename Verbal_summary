Verbal summary of the implementation:
*The code retrieves data from the YouTube Data API, stores it in a MongoDB database, and later transfers some of that data to a MySQL database for analysis.
*Importing necessary libraries, including modules for working with Google's YouTube Data API, MongoDB, MySQL, and Streamlit for building web interfaces.
*Setting up the YouTube Data API by providing an API key and specifying the API service and version.

Defining functions for various tasks:
 dropdownlist(): Creates a list of channel names for selection.
duration(data): Converts video duration in ISO 8601 format to hours.
get_channel_details(channel_id): Retrieves details about a YouTube channel using the API.
get_playlist_details(playlist_id): Fetches video IDs from a channel's playlist ID.
get_video_details(video_ids): Retrieves details of videos using their IDs.
get_comment_details(video_ids): Gathers comments on videos.
data_to_mongo(data): Stores channel, video, and comment details in a MongoDB database.
retrieve(data): Retrieves data from MongoDB and inserts it into a MySQL database.
analysis(data): Executes SQL queries and displays results in Streamlit.
Setting up a Streamlit web application with sections for data collection, data conversion, and data analysis.

Conclusion:
In the data collection section, users can input a YouTube channel ID and click a button to retrieve data from the API, which is then stored in MongoDB.

In the data conversion section, users can select a channel name from a dropdown list and click a button to transfer data from MongoDB to MySQL.
